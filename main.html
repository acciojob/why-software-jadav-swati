	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>As a Software Developer you constantly provide solutions for users' problems.
	Being in Software Development isn’t quite the same as being a Graphic Designer or Fine Artist, but that doesn’t mean it’s not creative in its own way.
        There are many ways in which Software Developers can be creative, including in the way you think to solve a problem</p>
